# GDLiveCollab

Ever felt like sharing the editor with someone? Well now* you can! (*now being when this app is in a usage-ready state)

## Goals:

 - Create a *functional* demo of a live collabing system.
   * Goals do not include making a *good* system, goals are just to demonstrate how one could be made with a simple basic proof of concept.

## Installation & Usage:

1. `git clone`, `./run.bat`. / Download latest release and run `GDLiveCollab.exe`
